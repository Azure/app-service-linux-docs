    jointly learns sentence segmentation and labelled dependency parsing, and can
    optionally learn to merge tokens that had been over-segmented by the tokenizer.

    The parser uses a variant of the non-monotonic arc-eager transition-system
    described by Honnibal and Johnson (2014), with the addition of a "break"
    transition to perform the sentence segmentation. Nivre's pseudo-projective
    dependency transformation is used to allow the parser to predict
    non-projective parses.

    The parser is trained using an imitation learning objective. The parser follows
    the actions predicted by the current weights, and at each state, determines
    which actions are compatible with the optimal parse that could be reached
    from the current state. The weights such that the scores assigned to the
    set of optimal actions is increased, while scores assigned to other
    actions are decreased. Note that more than one action may be optimal for
    a given state.

    model (Model): The model for the transition-based parser. The model needs
        to have a specific substructure of named components --- see the
        spacy.ml.tb_framework.TransitionModel for details.

        updated and evaluated. If 'moves' is None, a new instance is

    update_with_oracle_cut_size (int): During training, cut long sequences into
        shorter segments by creating intermediate states based on the gold-standard
        history. The model is not very sensitive to this parameter, so you usually
        won't need to change it. 100 is a good default.

        structure, as the labels are used to represent the pseudo-projectivity
