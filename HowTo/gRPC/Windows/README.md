# gRPC on Windows App Service (preview)

> ## Support Status
> gRPC on Windows App Service is currently a **preview** feature that is enabled using in-process hosting only with ASP.NET.  Additional support for out-of-proc scenarios, Windows container, and Java support is being worked on and planned for this calendar year.  Site activation through gRPC is also not yet supported and must have Always On turned on in the configuration settings.
