# Changing WordPress Admin credentials
 WordPress admin credentials are passed onto WordPress via **Application Settings** of App Service during the installation time. These settings are **non-persistent** in nature and any changes to these App Settings after the installation is completed will have no impact on the WordPress application.

To change admin credentials, you need to login to the admin dashboard of your WordPress and change it from there.
