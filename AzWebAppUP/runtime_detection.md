# Troubleshoot auto-detect runtime issues with `az webapp up`

The [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) includes a set of commands to manage Web App resources ([learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/webapp?view=azure-cli-latest)). Included in this set of commands `az webapp up` bundles functionality to **create** a Web App and **deploy code** from a local workspace. Current support includes apps targeting:

- [Python](#python-detection-logic)
- [Node](#node-detection-logic)
- [ASP .NET and - .NET Core](#ASP-.NET-and-.NET-Core-detection-logic)

As part of the execution of `az webapp up` command it performs a **best effort** detection to match your code (in your local directory) with a supported runtime in your Web App.

# Troubleshooting  Steps

1. Make sure you are in the right folder. `az webapp up` should be run from the local folder containing your code. The most common mistake is running the command in the parent directory. 
2. Confirm your project structure complies with requirements outlined in the the "Automatic Runtime Detection Logic" section below.

## Automatic Runtime Detection Logic
The runtime detections logic uses the hints outlined below. Any code that doesnâ€™t match this logic is blocked to avoid compatibility issues.

### Python detection logic

Python detection looks for the existence of a file titled `requirements.txt` in the root folder of the project.

### Node detection logic

Node detection looks for the existence of the `package.json` or `sever.js` or `index.js` in the root folder of the project.

### ASP .NET and .NET Core detection logic

ASP .NET and .NET Core detection is done by looking for the existence of `*.csproj` in the root folder of the project.

### .NET 5

Detection logic for .NET 5 apps will look into your `*.csproj` file in the current folder.

Detection will then check value set for  `TargetFramework` element looking for `net5.0` string.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

</Project>
```


### HTML

Static content needs to use the explicit `--html` flag to indicate that static content is being deployed. Validation is done by looking for `*.html` or `*.htm` or `*.shtml` files in the root folder of the project.

### Manual runtime definition

The runtime is a property of the web app used to host your code. If you want to set the runtime manually you can use the [az webapp create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/webapp?view=azure-cli-latest#az-webapp-create) command.
