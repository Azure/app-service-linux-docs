# Python on App Service

## Python Update Policy

App Service upgrades the underlying Python runtime of your application as part of the regular platform updates. As a result of this regular update process, your application will be automatically updated to the latest patch version of Python available for that platform.

### Python 2.7 End of Official Support

Once a version of Python has reached it's end of support no new critical or security fixes will be available.

On February 2, 2020 Python 2.7 will not longer be offered as an option in the create process for App Service. Existing apps targeting Python 2.7 will not be affected.
